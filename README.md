# AI Diet Coach

Welcome to this AI Diet Coach. This web app was created as a project for Flatiron's software engineering program. The goal of this app was to practice and show proficiency and understanding of react.js, redux, and redux-thunk. This app was completed in two weeks and a is currently being re-done using React Native as a mobile application. The app allows users to sign up and enter basic information about themselves such as age, gender, height, and weight along with lifestyle factors and a body composition goal. The app will then calculate macronutrient recommendations for each meal each day that will allow the user to reach their body composition goal by the goal date they selected when signing up for the app.

The user can then create meals using an external API that accesses the USDA food database to get nutrient info of all common foods.

Due to the short time frame and being the first time using React.js, this version is a very primative version of the future mobile version currently being developed. You can find the link to the new repository here soon.

You can find the rails back end here: https://github.com/mtrimner/ai-diet-coach-backend
